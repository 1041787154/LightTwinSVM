This program is created for researchers and students who want to use TwinSVM classifier. 

Twin Support Vector Machine classifier proposed by:
Khemchandani, R., & Chandra, S. (2007). Twin support vector machines for pattern classification. IEEE Transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 29(5), 905-910.

The main features of the program are the following:
- A simple console program for running TwinSVM classifier
- Fast optimization algorithm: The ClippDCD algorithm was improved and is implemented in C++ for solving optimization problems of TwinSVM.
- K-fold cross validation supported.
- It supports grid search.
