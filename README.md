## Intro
LightTwinSVM is a simple and fast implementation of standard Twin Support Vector Machine. Anyone who is interested in machine learning and classification can use this program for their work/projects.
 
The main features of the program are the following:
- A simple console program for running TwinSVM classifier
- Fast optimization algorithm: The ClippDCD algorithm was improved and is implemented in C++ for solving optimization problems of TwinSVM.
- Both Linear and RBF kernel are supported.
- K-fold cross validation supported.
- Training/Test split supported.
- It supports grid search over C and gamma parameters.
- Detailed classification result will be saved in a spreadsheet file.

## Installation Guide
In order to build and run the program, the following Python packages are needed:
- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html)

In order to build C++ extension module(Optimizer), the following tools and libraries are required:
- [GNU C++ Compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [Armadillo C++ Linear Algebra Library](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)
- [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/)and[BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/)Library

Currently, Supported operating systems are as follows:
- Debian-based Linux systems (Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu 17.10)
- RPM-based Linux systems (Fedora)

**A Linux shell is created to help users download required dependencies and install program automatically.** However, make sure that [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and GNU C++ compiler is installed on your system.

To install the program, open a terminal and execute the following commands:
'''
git clone https://github.com/mir-am/LightTwinSVM.git
cd LightTwinSVM && ./setup.sh
'''
