# Intro
LightTwinSVM is a simple and fast implementation of standard Twin Support Vector Machine. Anyone who is interested in machine learning and classification can use this program for their work/projects.
 
The main features of the program are the following:
- A simple console program for running TwinSVM classifier
- Fast optimization algorithm: The ClippDCD algorithm was improved and is implemented in C++ for solving optimization problems of TwinSVM.
- Both Linear and RBF kernel are supported.
- K-fold cross validation supported.
- Training/Test split supported.
- It supports grid search over C and gamma parameters.
